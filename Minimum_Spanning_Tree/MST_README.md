# Minimum Spanning Tree

## Contents

* In this MST folder I will be writing the code to implement minimum spanning treeexample in python using pyomo. 

* The example that I will be using to illustrate this is the one from wikipedia. 

* The associated picture of the tree and solution to the tree can be found in the "mst.png" file in the folder.

* The code for the problem can be found in the "mst.py" file.

* I have also enclosed a set of handwritten notes to the MST problem, explaining what is MST and the constraints, caveats to solving the problem. Please have a look if you wish to get an idea.

* Please navigate to mu other repository to find the relevant documents. The link is enclosed in this file.
