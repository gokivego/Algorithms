# Stochastic Gradient Descent

*The file sgd.py contains elementary code to stochastic gradient descent. I will be adding more comments and explanation as to what each chunk of the code does.

*I will also be adding another chunk of code which is a vectorized version of the sgd algorithm which can be simultaneously processed on more than one initial points.
